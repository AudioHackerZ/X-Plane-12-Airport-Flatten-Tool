# X-Plane 12 Airport Flatten Tool (Simple Flatten 1)

## Introduction
This tool is specially designed for X-Plane 12 users to resolve terrain issues caused by the removal of the "Runways follow terrain contours" option.

It automatically edits the apt.dat file and batch adds/removes `1302 flatten 1` lines to manage airport terrain flattening.

### Use Cases
- Fix default airport terrain bugs in X-Plane 12;
- Quickly manage terrain flattening status for airports in regions such as China and the USA;
- Fix terrain issues caused by plugins.
- The simplest way to use, prepared for users who do not understand professional terrain modification tools.

### Important Notes
- This tool only modifies the apt.dat file;
- Please back up your original X-Plane 12 files before using;
- Current version is CLI-based, supporting both Simplified Chinese and English.
